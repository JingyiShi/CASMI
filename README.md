# CASMI
CASMI is short for Coverage Adjusted Standardized Mutual Information. This repository includes an R package that provides CASMI-based functions and the simulation evaluation code for CASMI-based feature selection. (The latest R package is now in CRAN! The GitHub version will not be updated anymore.)
For more information about CASMI, please refer to corresponding papers or contact me at jshi@math.msstate.edu.
